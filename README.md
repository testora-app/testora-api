# Project Name
> This is a template for starting a flask application. The basics have been set up

## Unit Tests
There is a test module set up for the application already using pytest

To run the tests, run this in the console
`python -m pytest tests`

## Conclusion
You can continue with your development after it runs successfully.

> NB: This template uses Flask Script, it is necessary to use Flask 1.1.2 to get the flask-script module to work.
> Using flask 2 will throw errors. Thanks.
